# Automated Arm Project (AAP)

The Automated Arm Project (AAP) is a robotic control system built around the SO-100 robotic arm from Hugging Face's LEROBOT platform.  
The 3D printable parts and hardware schematics are open-source and available on the official GitHub repository: https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot

## Hardware Overview

- Robotic Arm: SO-100 by Hugging Face (3D-printed and open-hardware)
- Motors: Feetech STS3215 serial bus servos
- Controller Board: Feetech FE-URT 1
- Communication Protocol: Feetech Serial Bus Servo Protocol (half-duplex UART)

## Software Overview

The project is developed in Python and controlled from the terminal.  
All core scripts are located in the AAP working directory.

Current functionalities include:

- Initialization and calibration of the arm
  - Manual motor control
  - Position feedback
  - Calibration storage and reuse
- Motion recording and playback
  - Live recording of motor positions
  - CSV-based motion replay

## Project Structure

- `main.py` : main entry point for basic motor testing and control
- `main_0.py` : set arm to 0 (rest) position
- `main_relax.py` : releases all motors (torque off)
- `main_manual_control.py` : manual keyboard-based motor control

### utils/
- `main_calibrate.py` : motor manual calibration script 
- `port_finder.py` : automatic detection of the FE-URT serial port

### core/
- `functions.py` : utility functions for motor control, including position conversion and movement helpers

### scripts/
- `follow.py` : movement recording and playback logic

### data/
- `.csv` files generated by `follow.py` containing recorded motor positions and timestamps

### config.py
- Stores motor calibration data (min, max, center) for each motor

### feurt_driver.py
- Low-level communication driver for the FE-URT 1 board using the Feetech serial protocol

## Roadmap

Planned improvements include:

- Improved error handling for communication
- Higher-level control features (e.g., trajectory planning)
- Support for additional interfaces (e.g., graphical UI, joystick)
- Extended documentation and setup guides
